This project consists of a dropgame where your goal is to catch raindrops in your bucket. 
As you start racking up points the game will get harder and harder. In this game you have 3 lives, and everytime you miss a drop you will lose a life. 
When all your hearts are gone you will be taken to the highscore screen where you can see how you did compared to other players(Not yet implemented). 
You may also choose to restard the game and try again.
